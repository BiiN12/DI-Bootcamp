suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more robust method for preventing XSS attacks, such as a library specifically designed for sanitizing user input when rendering recipeHTML.
- The repeated use of querySelector and getElementById could be optimized by caching the elements.
- Consider implementing error handling, especially when loading and saving from localStorage, to provide a better user experience.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the toggleFavoriteStatus method as required.
- Consider using UUID for generating unique recipe IDs in the RecipeItem class, as suggested in the project setup.
- The RecipeItem class is missing. Create a class that represents a single recipe with the specified properties (id, title, ingredients, instructions, isFavorite).
- The removeRecipe method should ideally use the recipe ID for comparison instead of direct object comparison to avoid issues.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding methods to show/hide recipe details as outlined in the requirements.
- The render method currently returns a string. It would be more flexible to return a DOM element.
- Implement event listeners for the favorite and delete buttons within the class for better encapsulation.
