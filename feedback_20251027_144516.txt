suggestions for improvement:
- The `Garage` component's `size` prop should be passed the value 'small' as per the instructions, but it is being passed 'big'.
- The Car component receives props named `name` and `model` but these are never passed to the Car component in the App.js file

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using more descriptive variable names for better readability (e.g., instead of `clicked`, use `isToggleOn`).
- The input field could be cleared more elegantly using `useState` hook, rather than directly manipulating the DOM element value.
