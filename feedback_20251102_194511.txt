suggestions for improvement:
- Ensure that the same quote is not displayed twice in a row. Implement logic to compare the new quote with the previous one and regenerate if they are the same.
- Consider extracting the color changing logic into a separate reusable function to improve code organization.
- Use descriptive variable names to enhance code readability (e.g., `randomColor` could be `generateRandomColor`).
- The initial state of quotes should be null or undefined, not an empty string.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is only a list of quotes and authors and does not fulfill the requirements of creating a React component for a random quote generator with the specified functionalities (displaying quotes, authors, generating new quotes on button click, changing background and text colors randomly).
- The code does not include any React components, state management, or event handling, which are key concepts mentioned in the 'What you will learn' section.
